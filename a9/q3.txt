The runtime is comparable to that of aRead for n=10, 100, because the threads replicate the asynchronous functionality that was
implemented in aRead.
However, for n = 1000, the run time for tRead is about 10x longer.
This is possibly due to thread functionality being more expensive than simple operations.
It seems to increase exponentially.
