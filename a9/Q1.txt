We observe that time spent reading grows in an approximately linear fashion.
The runtime performance correlates to the 10ms/read we were told about in the Background
section, since each program execution's runtime is the number of reads times 10ms, more or less.
The extra time is probably due to the other code that need to run (ie. the reading of the arguments
and the function calls, loops).
