Semaphores should be more fair because of the internal counter they have. With mutexes, we often
have the case where a condition variable is being looped on in order to ensure some state is being
met. When the mutex is unlocked, someone could steal the mutex and as long as the while condition is
met, it can effectively skip the line/queue of the mutex. This is what causes some people in the
well queue to wait unreasonably long. With semaphores, however, there's an internal counter/queue that
ensures the order of the threads being signalled/waited on. Because the position of the threads is
being kept, the issue of line skipping is removed.
